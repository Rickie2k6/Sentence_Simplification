In some cases, this could happen because poor-quality material was used when the bridge was built, or because a key piece of the bridge is weak. In other cases, the bridge was designed only to support a certain amount of weight and no more."}

{"text_id": "13-b1", "simplified": "Many of the main supermarkets have received negative comments in recent years, because it is said that they have done various bad or wrong things. They've wasted large amounts of food, they haven't paid enough money to the companies whose products they sell, and their products create a lot of plastic waste we don't need, which is damaging our environment. But markets and supermarkets are starting to care about this. In answer to increasing customer unhappiness about the huge amounts of waste from plastic covers, packets and boxes, some of the largest UK supermarkets have signed a promise to change their products and cut plastic waste."}

Children stand inside it, pick it up, put it around their middles, then move their bodies: they are trying to stop the hula hoop from falling down. The first time Wasfia Nazreen saw a hula hoop, she was a young girl living in Bangladesh. A foreign girl was playing with it. Wasfia wanted to try it, but she didn't, because people in Bangladesh didn't think girls should play with hula hoops or ride bikes. Now, Wasfia has climbed seven of the highest mountains in the world and, at the top of every mountain, she uses her hula hoop. Nobody else has ever done that! She does it because she wants to show other women and girls in her country that they can do different things. Her country doesn't like women who do sport."}

{"text_id": "15-a2", "simplified": "We've looked carefully at Girox Foods, and we have some advice. The company should change. The managers should see the workers as more important. For example, if the workers want to change when and where they work, it should be possible. We should give workers different jobs sometimes so they will be more interested. We should also show them more often that we like their work. We should spend more money on teaching them, for example about how to talk to people, especially people from other countries. If we do all these things, this will be a better place to work, and then people can do their best work here."}
