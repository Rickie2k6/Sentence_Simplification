The bad part is that I don’t have set work hours, so I often work late into the evening and sometimes miss dinner to finish my work."}

We will see if this plan works, but it might be hard because warmer winters mean there are more pigs now than before."}

A deeper connection is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen better to build stronger relationships."}

Methane does not last long, only a few hundred years. This means something on Mars is making more methane. NASA says Mars releases thousands of tons of methane at once. The amount of methane goes up and down with the seasons, like the planet is breathing."}
{"text_id": "94-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Early in her career, psychologist Carol Dweck from Stanford University gave some ten-year-olds difficult problems. One group liked the challenge and believed they could get better. She called this a 'growth mindset' because they focused on what they could achieve in the future. The other group felt judged and thought they had failed. They had a 'fixed mindset' and could not see how to improve. Some of these children said they might cheat later, while others looked for someone who did worse than them to feel better about themselves."}
{"text_id": "95-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Horror films like to use empty places. This can be an old hospital, a scary empty house, or a ghost town. There is something interesting about lonely places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they go away? These places are very quiet, which can be scary too. Also, abandoned places are good for horror film makers because there is usually no phone signal there."}
{"text_id": "96-a2", "simplified_sentence": "The basement is a scary place in horror films, no matter what type of house it is. It is often dark and wet. You can only get to it by a small staircase. Basements feel creepy, even if there is nothing there."}

He spent six months looking at CCTV videos and identified 190 people, often just by their eyes. His help was very important for the investigation. Even with 200,000 hours of video, the facial recognition software found only one person."}
{"text_id": "98-a2", "simplified_sentence": "I find it very interesting to think about how we can make our bodies better. Imagine if we could put a computer in our brain! Soon, we will be able to do this and improve our math skills, how we see and hear, and our memory. This idea will become more normal in the future."}
{"text_id": "99-a2", "simplified_sentence": "It was an interesting talk, and the speaker made some good points. For example, she talked about how parents influence their kids. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing homework if they see their parents using social media while cooking or waiting at a red light? She also mentioned how people want to be in many places at the same time. They often switch between talking in real life and online. I see this a lot with my teenage daughter and her friends. They meet up but then sit quietly, each talking to someone else online."}
{"text_id": "100-a2", "simplified_sentence": "There are news stories that make us think the world is more violent, but there is also some good news. From the end of World War II to 1990, there were 30 wars that killed over 100,000 people. Today, there are still civil wars, but most countries are living together more peacefully than before. However, terrorism has increased in the last few years, and since World War II, more civilians have died in wars than soldiers. Still, the news is not all bad for civilians. Even though violent crime is nine times more likely to cause death than political conflict, the global murder rate went down a little, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}
{"text_id": "101-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Wasfia has spent her life helping human rights. She has seen many projects in her country that teach women and girls, but often these projects stop, and the women are left with nothing. Wasfia realized that Bangladesh needed to be stronger, so she combined her love for climbing mountains and her work for human rights to change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing while helping in Tibet and Nepal because most people in flat Bangladesh have never seen a mountain. Her campaign is working, and more people in Bangladesh and around the world are paying attention."}
{"text_id": "102-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Many people think that developing countries are in a very bad place. They see a lot of poverty, bad leaders, and no hope for change. But this is not true. In fact, big changes are happening. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have earned more money and left poverty. Also, six million fewer children die from sickness each year, more girls are going to school, and many more people have clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Many managers try to make their feedback more positive by putting negative comments between two positive ones. But if this happens too often, workers may think the positive comments are just hiding the negative ones, which makes them less valuable. Positive feedback should not just cover up the negative. It should be given to support and encourage good work."}
{"text_id": "104-a2", "simplified_sentence": "I am part of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Forget the scary robots from movies. Right now, military machines like drones and robots are already used to kill with little help from people. The next step is robots that can decide who to kill by themselves. I believe this is very wrong and dangerous for people. We need to be careful about what we let machines do."}
{"text_id": "105-a2", "simplified_sentence": "More people are learning English than any other language, and English is spoken in the most countries. However, Chinese has the most native speakers. There is not much connection between the number of native speakers and the number of learners. But there is a stronger connection between the number of learners and how many countries speak the language."}
{"text_id": "106-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Your manager stops you and says she wants to talk about your work on the recent project. You feel worried all weekend, thinking about what you might have done wrong. On Monday morning, when you go into her office, she starts by saying good things about your work on the project. You think maybe this is just the usual way to give feedback. You know the feedback sandwich: say something nice, say what you really want to say, and then say something nice again."}
{"text_id": "107-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Born in the USA is a fast and exciting rock album. The songs are fun to listen to, but they also tell important stories. Many songs talk about the hard lives of regular people and their feelings of sadness and anger when they do not get rich or famous. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town remembering their youth when they felt strong and free. Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life becomes very hard after he loses his job. The artist seems to share real stories from people he knows and what his life could have been if he was not a star. This album shows the amazing talent of the artist, known as the Boss."}

He hopes this will help fix the damage caused by human activities like overfishing, pollution, and littering. Lewis has seen this damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs that are dying because the water is too warm and has seen empty areas under the Red Sea filled with plastic. Pugh believes that nature can heal if we give it space, but time is running out. If we do not take care of our seas, we may face a big problem soon."}

Now, she is not quiet anymore. She appears on popular daytime shows like Police Today and speaks at writing conferences across the UK."}
{"text_id": "110-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Are things getting worse every day? Is it impossible to make progress? In \"Enlightenment Now,\" Steven Pinker talks about human progress and shares good news. We are living longer, healthier, and happier lives. Pinker believes the real problem is that the values of reason and science are being attacked. When people focus on their groups, fear, and distrust, we risk harming important things like democracy and working together in the world."}
{"text_id": "111-a2", "simplified_sentence": "In old horror movies, when the main characters were in trouble, they often could not call for help or the police. Now, with mobile phones, this seems less real. So, how do they keep the suspense? They make sure there is no phone signal! If you are a hero in a horror movie, it is very likely that when you really need to call for help, you will have no signal. Or your phone battery will die right when you try to call. Or both will happen."}
{"text_id": "112-a2", "simplified_sentence": "In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America were losing their best product, the Gros Michel banana, also called Big Mike. Now, the same thing is happening to the Cavendish banana, which is the main type grown today. The Gros Michel banana was popular because it was sweet, had a thick skin, and was easy to transport. United Fruit, the biggest banana company in South America at that time, made a lot of bananas by cloning parts of the plants instead of using seeds. They grew the bananas in very crowded fields."}
{"text_id": "113-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Most spiders have venom to stun or kill their prey, not to attack humans. Only 25 types of spiders can harm people. Spider bites can hurt, but they usually are not deadly. The Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia has not killed anyone since 1981 when anti-venom was made. Be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel scared, they can release irritating hairs that can get stuck in your skin or eyes."}
{"text_id": "114-a2", "simplified_sentence": "This scary movie idea was very popular in horror films from the late 1900s. It starts with a group of teenagers having fun, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the start, the girl is usually innocent, shy, and not very strong. By the end, she becomes the strongest and smartest person. The last girl almost always wins."}
{"text_id": "115-a2", "simplified_sentence": "To understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to see how our brains are different from other animals. It is not just about brain size; we also need to think about what our brains can do and why they changed over time. There are not many physical clues to help us. The things left by our ancestors do not show us what kind of speech they could make. However, we can see changes in the mouth, throat, and tongue of early humans. About 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simpler sounds to communicate."}
{"text_id": "116-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Society, not nature, tells us that girls should like arts and humanities, while boys should like maths and physics. Many young people do not see positive female role models in science jobs. Cartoons and stories often show scientists, inventors, and astronauts as men. There is also a wrong idea that scientists are strange, have bad social skills, or work alone. These stereotypes from the media can make girls feel that science is not for them. If girls saw more positive female role models in science, they would feel more confident and included in those subjects."}

Students write and make the newspaper. A survey shows that university students and staff really like it for fun, culture, and work experience. Printing the newspaper costs a lot of money. Some students cannot easily get a copy because they have to go to the university to find it. Also, many copies become litter on campus, which is bad for the environment."}
{"text_id": "118-a2", "simplified_sentence": "At Girox Foods, about 12 out of every 100 employees leave each year. This number seems high because the usual rate in the industry is 7 out of 100. This report aims to find out why employees feel engaged at work and to suggest ways to make their experience better and keep them working here longer."}
{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified_sentence": "What the speaker said felt very true. I really believe that the more connected we are, the more alone we can feel. This is not a big problem for my generation because we lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and that it is OK to be alone. But for people under 20, it is different. They are always talking to others and may never feel alone. They might not learn how to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they are learning to talk through messages that can be changed, instead of learning how to have real conversations with people face to face."}
{"text_id": "120-a2", "simplified_sentence": "Don't always give negative feedback after positive feedback. If you always mix them, people may not value the positive comments. Sometimes, just give positive feedback without adding criticism."}
{"text_id": "21-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Your dreams can give you new ideas about things you didn't know you were thinking about.

{"text_id": "22-b1", "simplified_sentence": "One of the most interesting examples of wild animals in a city is the wild dogs of Moscow. There are about 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets of Moscow. Some of these dogs were born wild, while others were pets that their owners left behind. Some dogs live alone, and others live in groups. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted very well to city life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people, and some dogs seem to understand traffic lights."}

She knows they are not common pets, and she has tried many times to explain to people that rats are not dirty and can be great pets if cared for properly. She understands why some people have a negative reaction. Chloe also didn't like rats at first until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats, and she saw how loving and smart they are. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she wanted to have two of them."}
{"text_id": "25-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed in car accidents, and others have been electrocuted while playing with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species, so to protect them and reduce problems between people and baboons, the city council has hired a team of Baboon Monitors. Their job is to chase baboons out of the city or catch them and release them in the countryside. This plan has worked somewhat, but it is difficult to stop baboons from returning to the city when they find easy food there."}
{"text_id": "26-b1", "simplified_sentence": "I work for a global IT company, but their main office is in the United States, so I do all my work online from home. This way, I don’t waste time traveling or chatting with coworkers. I work on different projects, and this flexibility is important to me because I can take time off when my children have school events or when I need to go to the dentist. The downside is that without set office hours, I often work late into the evening and sometimes skip dinner to finish my work."}
{"text_id": "27-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In the 1990s, graffiti was still popular, but street art became very popular around the world. Some artists used their art to talk about important issues like war, inequality, and discrimination. Other street artists focused on creating beautiful and attractive pieces. In South America, many street artists worked in poor neighborhoods, bringing color, life, and beauty to dull city walls."}
{"text_id": "28-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Every day, social media, magazines, and store windows show people many things to buy. British shoppers are buying more clothes and shoes than ever. Online shopping makes it easy to buy things without thinking. Big brands sell very cheap clothes, so people often wear them a few times and then throw them away."}
{"text_id": "29-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Sam squinted at the sun and saw a dust trail from a car driving to the Big House. The horses kicked and swatted at flies, not caring that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter only came out here when he had to, which was good for Sam. The more he stayed out of his boss's way, the longer he would keep his job. Mr. Carter wiped sweat from his neck. The wet spots on his shirt looked like shapes on a map. His skin was already getting red in the June sun. He looked like a man who made money while others did the work."}
{"text_id": "30-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Many people in Berlin, Germany, said that shooting pigs is too cruel. This caused strong arguments between hunters and animal lovers. In response to the protests, the city council chose to take a kinder approach. Instead of shooting the pigs, they built fences and made it illegal to feed them. We will see if this plan works, but it might be hard because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before."}
{"text_id": "31-b1", "simplified_sentence": "An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of Greek mythology. When she was a child, one of her favorite stories was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens is controlled by Crete, but the people of Athens fight back. As a punishment, King Minos of Crete makes the Athenians send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people are put into a maze and eaten by a monster called the Minotaur. But one of the boys, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a modern version of Theseus."}
{"text_id": "32-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Zoos can help teach people about protecting animals and their homes by bringing them together.

{"text_id": "33-b1", "simplified_sentence": "A new trend is growing against consumerism called the 'buy nothing' trend. It started in Canada in the early 1990s and then spread to the US.

Throughout the year, Buy Nothing groups help people exchange and repair items they already have."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? It depends on how you see it. In many countries, writing or painting on public or private property is seen as vandalism.

{"text_id": "36-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Most people have four to six dreams every night after they turn ten. This means they can have about 2,000 dreams each year. By the time someone is 80 years old, they might have had around 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95–99 percent of our dreams, we still remember a few thousand dreams in our lives. It’s easy to think that sometimes a dream can happen before something similar occurs in real life, especially if the dream is about something we see often in our daily lives."}

{"text_id": "41-b1", "simplified_sentence": "One idea to protect Earth from a dangerous asteroid is to use a nuclear weapon to blow it up. This might sound like a movie story, and it was in the 1998 film Armageddon, but NASA has a real plan called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER). They would launch eight-ton rockets at an asteroid that is coming towards Earth, hoping to change its path. If the asteroid is too close for this to work, the rockets would have nuclear bombs to destroy it instead."}

{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea was that dreams show things we do not know about ourselves. Freud thought that if we understand our dreams, we can learn about our hidden feelings and the problems they create. The other idea was different. It said that dreams are just random activity in the brain while it organizes memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to understand these random images and feelings and create a story from them."}

So, I started working at a nearby café, but the Wi-Fi was not good, and I ended up drinking too much coffee. Finally, I decided to rent a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers. I enjoyed getting dressed for work in the morning and being able to focus in an office."}

Lucid dreams are when you know you are dreaming and can control what happens in the dream.

However, you might still want to have some dreams that let your mind share what it is thinking!"}
{"text_id": "50-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Many people do not know they are part of the problem with disposable clothing because they give their unwanted clothes to charities.

A lot of clothes are thrown away, and many that charities cannot sell are sent to other countries, creating more economic and environmental issues."}

For her, this shows that life is always changing, with endings and new beginnings."}

Her team was happy to share their thoughts. They said they were not used to being told what to do and preferred having more freedom to take initiative and be creative. When Gabriela told them exactly what to do, they felt she did not trust them to do their jobs well. They understood that Gabriela took it personally when they tried to question or change her decisions, and they explained that this was how they had always worked."}

She has lost her father in a mining accident and needs to find food for her family. She hunts in the woods near District 12 with her friend Gale and becomes very good with a bow and arrow. When her younger sister, Prim, is picked as one of the tributes, Katniss decides to go in her place. The other tribute from District 12 is a boy named Peeta, and Katniss quickly gets into a complicated relationship with him."}
{"text_id": "62-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Writing about your dreams will help you remember more details. Think about the people and places in your dreams, as they can add meaning. After a week, you might be surprised by how much you have written. You can then start to link your dreams to what happens and how you feel in your daily life."}
{"text_id": "63-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In the past, many bridges were made of wood, which could easily catch fire. This was especially true for old train bridges, where sparks from the steel wheels and tracks could start a fire and burn the bridge down."}
{"text_id": "64-b1", "simplified_sentence": "We cannot predict how street art will change in the future, but we can see some trends. Most street artists are young people who create art in their own cities or neighborhoods. However, more artists are now traveling and working in different countries. Many artists also use the internet to communicate and share pictures of their work. Additionally, the art world is starting to recognize street art as a real form of art. Although we are unsure about the future of street art, we can be certain that it will continue to exist!"}
{"text_id": "65-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Suzanne Collines has always felt upset by news programs about wars. When she was a child, her father was a pilot in the US Air Force and fought in Vietnam. Her mother tried to protect her by not talking about the war, but Suzanne still saw news programs and knew her dad was there. This was a very scary experience for her."}
{"text_id": "66-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In a global survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), over 40,000 people, both millennials (born between 1983 and 1993) and non-millennials, shared their views on workplace culture, communication, pay, career growth, and work-life balance. In another global survey by Deloitte, more than 10,000 millennials took part in a study about their thoughts on the challenges and chances in today’s work environment."}
{"text_id": "67-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Erik Weihenmayer is an adventurer from the United States. He has ridden a bike in the deserts of Morocco, kayaked in the Grand Canyon, and climbed Mount Everest. Erik has been blind since he was 13 years old. Besides his adventures, he helps people with disabilities to live active lives and takes groups of young blind people on climbing trips."}
{"text_id": "68-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Online platforms are giving people a chance to make some extra money. For example, busy parents used to avoid selling their children's old things at local markets or car boot sales. Now, with online marketplaces, they can easily sell baby clothes that their children have outgrown and expensive baby equipment. This helps them earn some cash."}
{"text_id": "69-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Pi and Richard Parker stay in the lifeboat for 227 days. They face hunger, sickness, and tiredness. They go through strong storms and the hot sun of the Pacific, but they manage to survive. Sometimes, Pi feels comfort from his three religions, but other times he feels very lonely and sad. Finally, they see the Mexican coast in the distance, and everything changes. I won’t tell you the ending, so you need to read the book to find out what happens to Pi and Richard Parker when they see land."}
{"text_id": "70-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Chloe got home from school, made a cup of coffee, and took it to her bedroom. She had homework to do, but she decided to do it later. She wanted to enjoy the quiet time before her parents came home and the house became noisy with talking, the TV, or her dad listening to jazz while cooking dinner. She also liked this time because she could play with her pet rats."}
{"text_id": "71-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In 2010, NASA's planetary defense team found and recorded 90 percent of the asteroids near Earth that are 1 km wide. These are called 'near-Earth objects' or NEOs, and they are the size of mountains. They include anything within 50 million kilometers of Earth's orbit. NASA estimates there are about 50 more to find, but they say none of the 887 known NEOs are a serious threat to our planet."}
{"text_id": "72-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Auggie decides to go to school, but he is very nervous on his first day. Like any child starting a new school, he feels anxious. However, because of his appearance, it is even harder for him. Other kids do not want to sit with him, and he sees them staring or whispering about him. Luckily, he makes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he talks to at lunch. But the first day is not the only challenge. Auggie finds out that his classmates are afraid to touch him, thinking they might catch 'the plague'. Throughout the school year, Auggie experiences many ups and downs, and then a surprising and difficult event at a school camp changes everything."}
{"text_id": "73-b1", "simplified_sentence": "The two men looked towards the northern part of the land. It went on for a long way, and they could hardly see the fences. Even if a bored teenage boy wanted to escape, he couldn't do it on foot. Sam watched the biggest horse, which was kicking the ground with its strong hooves. He wondered if the boy could ride. A good rider could find a lot of trouble out there, far from anyone. But someone who didn't know anything about horses and wanted to run away from his father might get into even more trouble."}
{"text_id": "74-b1", "simplified_sentence": "More than 4,000 climbers, aged from thirteen to eighty, have reached the top of Everest. Climbing high mountains in cold weather and strong storms is still very dangerous, but the best climbers are now looking for new challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria started to love mountain climbing when she was a teenager. After finishing school, she worked as a nurse but continued to climb in her free time."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified_sentence": "After climbing Everest, Gerlinde chose to climb all fourteen of the world's mountains that are 8,000 meters high. To make it more challenging, she climbs without using oxygen tanks. This is dangerous because the low oxygen at the top of high mountains can harm the brain and body. Gerlinde also uses her fame as a climber to help a charity for poor children and orphans in Nepal."}
{"text_id": "76-b1", "simplified_sentence": "If we look at the things we have bought in our lives, we can see that not everything is used well. For example, we might have a thick wool coat that we thought was stylish, even though we live in a hot country. We might have a smartphone that we stopped using when we got a new one. There could be a car that we only drive on weekends, or a guest room in our house that has become a storage room."}
{"text_id": "77-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Throughout history and in different cultures, dreams have been linked to prophecy. People believed that dreams were messages from the gods, meant to give us knowledge or understanding. Even today, many people remember a time when they dreamed about something, like an event, place, or person, and later that dream came true in real life."}
{"text_id": "78-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Some of the largest and most costly transportation projects in the world are about building bridges. Bridges are important because they allow cars, trucks, and trains to cross rivers, deep valleys, or other roads. Because of this, they are a key part of civil engineering and are closely watched, especially if they fall down."}
{"text_id": "79-b1", "simplified_sentence": "After weeks of feeling frustrated, Gabriela emailed her Swedish manager about the problems she was having with her team. Her manager asked her if she thought her team was still doing well and what could help her work better with her team members. Gabriela thought her manager was unclear and did not feel he was handling the situation well."}
{"text_id": "80-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Dogs that live in groups have learned that humans often give food to smaller, cuter dogs. So, these dogs are sent to ask for food for the whole group. Some dogs have even figured out how to use the metro system to move around their area! Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their strong sense of smell to recognize the scents of their favorite places. Another idea is that they can understand the names of stations from the announcements. Now, metro passengers are so used to seeing dogs on the trains that they often don’t notice them."}
{"text_id": "81-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Ed Stafford from the UK is the first person to walk the whole length of the Amazon River. He began at a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and reached the river's mouth in Brazil after two years and four months, walking 6,000 kilometers. The Amazon rainforest has dangerous animals like poisonous snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars, so Ed was always at risk. Fortunately, he only got a few thousand bites from mosquitoes and ants."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In Britain, the average person spends over £1,000 on new clothes each year, which is about four percent of their income. This may not seem like a lot, but it shows two bigger problems for society and the environment. First, many people are using credit cards to pay for these clothes. Right now, British adults owe about £670 each to credit card companies. This is 66 percent of what they spend on clothes. Also, people are spending money they don’t have to buy things they don’t need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year, and most of it ends up in landfills."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Ed's walk would not have been possible without technology. He used a radio to ask the people in the rainforest for food and to cross their land. Many of them came to meet him and helped him through the tough areas. While he walked, Ed wrote a blog about his daily experiences. He used the media's interest in his trip to speak out against the destruction of the rainforest and to raise money for environmental and children's charities in Brazil and Peru."}
{"text_id": "84-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Businesses have realized that they can make money from the sharing economy by using resources that are not fully used. A popular business model now is for companies to create online platforms that connect customers with people who offer specific products or services. For example, Airbnb helps people rent out their empty rooms and houses for extra income. Another example is Uber, which allows people to use their own cars as taxis to earn some extra money in their free time."}
{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified_sentence": "One important job of modern zoos is to help with breeding programs for endangered animals. In the wild, some rare animals have trouble finding mates and having babies. They also face dangers from poachers, losing their homes, and other animals that hunt them. A good zoo allows these animals to live and breed safely. As the number of some wild animals decreases, there is a risk that their genes become too similar. Breeding programs help by allowing zoo-bred animals to be released into the wild, which increases genetic diversity."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Both types of accidents are very rare, but boats and trains can cause a bridge to fall for different reasons. For trains, it's the speed of the impact that can make a bridge collapse. For boats, it's their heavy weight that can cause the bridge to fall, even if they are moving slowly. The best way to prevent bridge failures is to plan ahead. New technologies that can find weak spots, safer work areas, and better designs can all help to reduce these serious accidents."}
{"text_id": "87-b1", "simplified_sentence": "At first, Pi is very scared of the animals and jumps into the ocean. Then he remembers there are hungry sharks in the water and realizes he must climb back into the lifeboat. One by one, the animals in the lifeboat kill and eat each other, until only Pi and a tiger are left. Luckily for Pi, the tiger, whom he names Richard Parker, is feeling sick and does not want to eat him right away."}
{"text_id": "88-b1", "simplified_sentence": "When Pi is 16, a new government is elected that his parents do not like. Worried about what will happen next, Pi's parents decide to close the zoo and move to Canada. They sell some animals to zoos in North America and travel by ship to Canada with the remaining animals. During the journey, a terrible storm happens, and the ship sinks. Sadly, Pi's family and the sailors drown, but Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a big tiger."}
{"text_id": "89-b1", "simplified_sentence": "The Hunger Games is a very popular book for teenagers and young adults written by American author Suzanne Collins. Since it came out in 2008, it has been translated into 26 languages and has sold millions of copies worldwide. It was also the first book for young readers to sell over a million electronic copies. The Hunger Games is now a big Hollywood movie and is just as successful, making 152.5 million dollars in its first weekend in North America!"}
{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Dreams might happen because our mind is sorting out the thoughts we have during the day, but they show up in dreams with special meanings. When we are awake, we usually think in words, like talking to ourselves. However, when we sleep, the part of our brain that helps us use language is less active, while the part that deals with emotions is more active."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Having good relationships is very important for happiness. In one study, most happy people had strong connections with friends and family and spent time with them often. You also need at least one person to share your personal feelings with, which is called 'self-disclosure'. Just one close friend is enough, along with other relationships. It’s not enough to have many friends just to hang out or talk about music or football. That deeper connection is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen better to build stronger relationships."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Psychologist Carol Dweck, who supports the idea of a 'growth mindset', talked about how our brains can change and how we can improve skills and talents that we may not have been good at before. Many people often praise the final result and natural talents, like saying, \"You have a great eye for details\" or \"You are really good at organizing events.\" However, research shows that if we focus on the process of doing things—like praising effort, trying new things, and solving problems—we can help people develop new skills and improve their talents."}
{"text_id": "93-b1", "simplified_sentence": "The rover checks the air around it from time to time, and in 2014 it discovered that the air had methane, which is a simple organic molecule and an important part of natural gas. Methane only lasts for a few hundred years, so something on Mars must be making more of it. NASA says that Mars releases thousands of tons of methane at once. The amount of methane goes up and down with the seasons, almost like the planet is breathing."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Early in her career, psychologist Carol Dweck from Stanford University gave some ten-year-olds problems that were a bit too difficult for them. One group reacted well; they said they loved challenges and believed they could improve their skills. Dweck calls this a 'growth mindset' because they focus on what they can achieve in the future. However, another group of children felt their intelligence was being judged and thought they had failed. They had a 'fixed mindset' and could not see how they could get better. Some of these children said they might cheat later, while others looked for someone who did worse than them to feel better about themselves."}
{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Horror films often use empty places. This can be an abandoned hospital, a spooky empty house, or a ghost town. There is something interesting about these lonely places. What was life like when people lived there? Why did they leave? The silence in these places can also be very scary. Plus, abandoned places are useful for horror film directors because there is usually no phone signal there."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified_sentence": "No matter what type of house it is, the basement is a scary place in horror movies. It's often where something is hiding or where the bad person keeps their tools. Basements are usually dark and wet. You can only get to them by a narrow staircase. They always feel creepy, even when there is nothing there."}
{"text_id": "97-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Gary Collins, a policeman who was not on duty, was watching the London riots on TV. He quickly recognized some people and decided to cut his holiday short to help identify them. He spent six months looking at CCTV footage and identified 190 people, often just by their eyes. His help was very important for the investigation. Even though there were 200,000 hours of video, facial recognition software only identified one person."}
{"text_id": "98-b1", "simplified_sentence": "I find it interesting to think about how we can make our evolution faster by improving our bodies. Imagine if we could put a computer in our brain! Soon, we will be able to do this and improve our math skills, how we see and hear, and our memory. This idea will become more common in the future."}
{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified_sentence": "It was an interesting talk, and the speaker made some great points. For example, she talked about how parents influence their children. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing homework if they see their parents using social media while cooking or waiting at a red light? She also mentioned how people want to be in many places at once, so they switch between real-life and online conversations. I notice this a lot with my teenage daughter and her friends. They plan to meet but then sit together in silence, each talking to someone else online."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified_sentence": "While news stories often make us think the world is getting more violent, there is also some good news. From the end of World War II to 1990, there were 30 wars that killed over 100,000 people. Today, there are still civil wars, but most countries are living together more peacefully than before. However, terrorism has increased in recent years, and since World War II, more civilians have died in wars than soldiers. On a positive note, even for civilians, the numbers are not all bad. Although violent crime is nine times more likely to cause death than political conflict, the global murder rate has slightly decreased, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}
{"text_id": "101-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Wasfia has spent her life helping human rights and has seen many projects in her country that teach women and girls. However, when these projects end, the women are often left with nothing. Wasfia realized that Bangladesh needed to be stronger, so she combined her love for climbing and her work in human rights to change how people view women in her country. She started climbing while working on humanitarian projects in Tibet and Nepal, since most people in flat Bangladesh have never seen a mountain. Her campaign is working, as people in Bangladesh and around the world are starting to pay attention."}
{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Many people think that developing countries are in a very bad situation, facing extreme poverty, ruled by dictators, and having little chance for change. However, this is not true. In fact, a big change is happening. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have raised their income and escaped poverty. Also, six million fewer children die each year from diseases, more girls are going to school, and many more people have clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Many managers try to make their feedback more positive by placing negative comments between two positive ones. However, if this becomes a habit, employees may start to see positive comments as just a way to soften the negative ones, which makes them less valuable. Positive feedback should not just be used to soften the negative; it should be given to support and encourage good performance."}
{"text_id": "104-b1", "simplified_sentence": "I am part of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Forget the scary image of a Terminator from movies. Right now, military machines like drones and robots are already being used to kill with little human control. The next step could be robots that decide who to kill by themselves. I believe this would be very wrong and dangerous for people. We need to be very careful about what we let machines do."}
{"text_id": "105-b1", "simplified_sentence": "More people are learning English than all other languages together, and English is spoken in the most countries. However, Chinese has the most native speakers. There is not much connection between the number of native speakers of a language and the number of learners. But there is a stronger connection between the number of learners and how many countries have speakers of that language."}
{"text_id": "106-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Your manager stops you and says she wants to talk about your work on the recent project. You feel worried all weekend, thinking about what you might have done wrong. When you go into her office on Monday morning, she starts by complimenting you on the good work you did. You wonder if this is just the usual nice comment before the real feedback. You know how the feedback sandwich works: say something nice, give the real feedback, and then say something nice again."}
{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Born in the USA is a fast and exciting rock album, but its lyrics are deep and emotional. The catchy rock songs tell stories about the difficult side of the American dream. Many songs talk about the struggles of everyday people and the anger they feel when life does not give them success or happiness. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town remembering their youth when they felt full of hope, while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job. It’s easy to see that the artist is inspired by real people he knew and the life he could have had if he hadn’t become famous. This album shows the amazing talent of the Boss."}
{"text_id": "108-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Lewis wants to increase the number of marine protected areas in the world from 3 percent to 10 percent. He believes this can help fix the damage caused by human activities like overfishing, pollution, and littering. During his trips, Lewis has seen this environmental damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs that have lost their color because of warmer water and has seen lifeless areas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea filled with plastic. Pugh thinks that nature can heal if we give it a chance, but time is running out. If we don’t start taking care of our oceans, we might face a big problem soon."}
{"text_id": "109-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Best-selling author Terrie Sharp knows how to tell great stories. She has won the Olive Crime Writer Award two times. Terrie grew up in a tough neighborhood in Glasgow, where she learned to stay quiet and avoid trouble. She even learned how to open car doors with a knife, but she only used this knowledge for her books. Now, she is not so quiet anymore. She appears on popular daytime shows like Police Today and speaks at writing conferences across the UK."}
{"text_id": "110-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Are things getting worse every day? Is it impossible to make progress? In \"Enlightenment Now,\" Steven Pinker examines human progress and finds good news. We are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. Pinker believes the real problem is that the values of reason and science from the Enlightenment are being attacked. When people focus on tribalism, hopelessness, and distrust, we risk harming important institutions like democracy and global cooperation."}
{"text_id": "111-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In older horror films, when the main characters were in trouble, it was hard or impossible for them to get help or call the police. Now, with mobile phones, this seems less believable. So, how do filmmakers keep the suspense? They use no phone coverage! If you are a hero in a horror movie, it’s almost certain that at a crucial moment, when you really need help, you won’t have any signal. Or your phone battery will die just as you try to call. Or both will happen."}
{"text_id": "112-b1", "simplified_sentence": "In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America were losing their most profitable product, the Gros Michel banana, also called Big Mike. Now, the same thing is happening to the Cavendish banana, which is the main type grown today. The Gros Michel banana was popular because it was easy to transport, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet. United Fruit, the biggest banana grower and exporter in South America at that time, produced bananas very efficiently. They cloned shoots from the plants instead of growing them from seeds and planted them closely together in fields."}
{"text_id": "113-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Most spiders have venom that helps them catch their prey, not to attack humans. Only 25 types of spiders can harm people, and while their bites can hurt, they usually are not deadly. For example, the Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia has not caused any deaths since the anti-venom was created in 1981. However, be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel threatened, they can release irritating hairs that can stick to your skin or eyes."}
{"text_id": "114-b1", "simplified_sentence": "This horror film idea was very popular in the late 20th century. It begins with a group of teenagers having fun, and it ends with everyone dead except for one girl. At first, the girl is usually innocent, shy, and not very strong. By the end, she becomes the strongest and smartest person. The last girl almost always wins in the end."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified_sentence": "To understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It's not just about brain size; we also need to consider what other functions our brains have and how they developed over time. There are not many physical clues to help us; the tools left by our ancestors do not show us what kind of speech they could make. However, we can see changes in the mouth, throat, and tongue of early humans. About 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simpler sounds to communicate."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Society, not nature, tells us that girls should like arts and humanities, while boys should focus on maths and physics. There are also not many positive female role models in science jobs for young people to see. Cartoons and stories often show scientists, inventors, and astronauts as men. Additionally, there is a wrong idea that scientists are nerdy, have bad social skills, or work alone and are disconnected from the world. These stereotypes from the media can make girls feel they do not belong in science and see it as an unattractive career. If girls saw more positive female role models in science, it would help them feel more confident and included in those subjects."}
{"text_id": "117-b1", "simplified_sentence": "The Scallion is a weekly newspaper that is given out for free in faculty buildings. About 10,000 students read it. It is made by students. A survey shows that university students and staff really appreciate the newspaper for entertainment, culture, and work experience. Printing the newspapers costs a lot of money. Also, some students find it hard to get a copy because they have to go to the university to pick one up. Another problem is that many copies end up as litter on campus."}
{"text_id": "118-b1", "simplified_sentence": "At Girox Foods, we have an annual employee turnover of about 12 percent. This may not seem high, but the industry average is 7 percent. The main goal of this report is to look into why employees are engaged at our company and to give suggestions on how to improve their experience at work and keep them longer."}
{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified_sentence": "What the speaker said felt very true to me. I really believe that the more connected we are, the more alone we can feel. This is not a big problem for my generation, as we have lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and understand that it’s okay to be alone. But for those under 20, it’s different. They are so busy talking online that they don’t get to feel alone and might not learn how to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they are learning to talk through messages that can be changed, instead of learning how to have real conversations with people face to face."}
{"text_id": "120-b1", "simplified_sentence": "Don't always give negative feedback after positive feedback. If you always mix them together, people might not value the positive comments and may ignore them. Make sure to give positive feedback on its own sometimes, and try not to add criticism right after."}
